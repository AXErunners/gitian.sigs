This repository is for deterministic build results for AXE releases.

See the [release process](https://github.com/AXErunners/axe/blob/master/doc/release-process.md)

[Instructions for setting up a virtual machine](https://github.com/AXErunners/axe/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md) in which you can
gitian build can also be found there.
